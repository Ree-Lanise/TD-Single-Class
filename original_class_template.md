# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe


## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can focus on tasks to complete
I want to mark tasks as complete and have them disappear from the list.

## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE

class TaskCompleted():
    def __init__(self, task, id):
        pass

    def task_completed(self, task):
        pass

    def remove(self):
        pass

```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

``` python
# EXAMPLE

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
